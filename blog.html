        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2023</h2>
        <p>College bureaucracies have been growing at least since the 1980s. I was then editor of a mildly disputatious 
            Duke University publication called the Faculty Newsletter. The one thing that seems to be remembered from
             those days is the “VP Count:” The number of people in the administration with “vice president” or
              “vice provost” in their title. On the first or second page of every issue of the Newsletter, 
              in large letters, appeared the current number of VPs. Finally, I got data from the Duke Archives 
              and published a graph in November 1991, plotting the number of vice presidents from 1959 to 1991. 
              The graph rose with only one small dip, 
            from three in 1959 to 19 in 1991. Now we might have to convert to a log scale.</p>
